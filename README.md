# Umbraco + MiniSearch

This repo contains the sample code for my [blog post](https://kjac.dev/posts/building-a-search-service-from-scratch/) about building a Node.js search service from scratch with MiniSearch and integrating it with the Umbraco Delivery API.

There are multiple projects in this repo. Please check the blog post for a details on how to run the whole thing.
